# One Piece Blitz
This game is my first project at Ironhack, part of the Web Development course.

## tl;dr - let me play it!
Alright, here's a [link](https://fernandoyto.github.io/fernandoyto-one-piece-blitz.io/) to the game.

## About the game
I decided to create an adapted version of the game 'Fantasma Blitz', which is a game that tests players reactions and visual perceptions. I believe that the best way to explain how to play the original version of the game is by watching either this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1x3picEes8) (Portuguese) or this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLiyeNpOXKQ) (English).

### How to play
Alright, assuming that you watched either one of the videos, now I can explain how I have adapted the game using a combination of a few One Piece characters and their respective hats. Let me introduce you to them:

|  Monkey D. Luffy  |  Trafalgar D. Law  |  Tony Tony Chopper  |  Sabo  |  Portgas D. Ace  |
|:-----------------:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|:------:|:----------------:|
| ![luffy](https://avatarfiles.alphacoders.com/766/76661.jpg)      | ![law](https://66.media.tumblr.com/79c0c1cdfd872cc84ad1b51b71ac40d9/4fedaa087d44add3-fc/s640x960/e6e32622e9f2b57251673fc4db82823ffc3f75ba.jpg) | ![chopper](https://lastfm.freetls.fastly.net/i/u/300x300/f0bca9192d7343239b2ac1e06c1d4b76.jpg) | ![sabo](https://66.media.tumblr.com/72c359a882f96f381095ddfa5c5eb2fa/cd1e733e0c9e61cf-1b/s640x960/f7b655473354ddbf3d92a5dc4aaf78619f6468d1.jpg) | ![ace](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e431f0f0b47aacb6bd5bd514834ee46e/tumblr_pizqzzy78b1sx8ybdo5_250.png)

See our dear pirates and their hats? Well that's the combination you're going to look for!

The game will show you 2 characters without their hats and 2 hats without its holders. If you see a matching combination, say a hatless Trafalgar D. Law and his white furry hat, you gotta press the key that corresponds to Law on the lower section of the page!

However, if there is no matching combination, then there certainly will be a character and its hat that were not displayed among the 2 characters and 2 hats displayed, and that character will be the correct answer for such combination displayed. For example, if Chopper, Sabo, Ace's hat and Law's hat are displayed, then nor Luffy or his hat have been displayed. Therefore, the correct answer is Luffy!


## Future improvements
- Add game rules and how to play section
- Improve feedback on user guesses
- Add ranking system
- Different game modes:
   * Local 1v1
   * Hard mode: limited time to answer each combination
