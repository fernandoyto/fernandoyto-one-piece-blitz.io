# One Piece Blitz
This game is my first project at Ironhack, part of the Web Development course.

I decided to code a digital version of the game 'Fantasma Blitz', which is a card game that tests players reactions. It is a multiplayer game, but, given time and skill constraints, I coded a simplified, single-player version of the game -- and used a few Character-Hat combinations from japanese anime 'One Piece' to simulate object-color combinations.

I studied Business Administration. After a few working experiences with simpler code in VBA and Python, I decided to jump head-first in this web development world. That's how I got here!
